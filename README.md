# 8-Podcast Knowledge Base (Master)
Goal: a durable library of **step-by-step methods** from 8 podcasts to help be happier, more confident, positive, and fit.

## Structure
- `catalog.csv` — index (podcast, episode, tags, status)
- `episodes/` — one Markdown per episode (front-matter + takeaways + steps)
- `transcripts/` — auto-fetched YouTube captions (if available)
- `build/index.json` — auto-generated by GitHub Actions (do not edit)

## Use
Add episodes to `catalog.csv` and `episodes/`. If YouTube IDs are in `sources.csv`, captions are fetched automatically.
